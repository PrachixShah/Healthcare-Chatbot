# Landing-page

This was my team's final project as a part of the WE Accelerate Microsoft Azure summer internship, in the summer of 2023. 

Alongside Microsoft Azure courseware, the goal was to develop chatbot that abides by the ethics of AI usage in our topic of interest - healthcare. In the development of this project, I used OpenAI's API, HTML, CSS, Javascript and knowledge bases to develop a chat application that responds to user's queries about healthcare in real time.
